For code associated with various coursework.

## Coursera
I'm currently working on the [NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing) on Coursera. This is broken up into four courses:
1. [Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp)
2. [Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-models-in-nlp)
3. [Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp)
4. [Natural Language Processing with Attention Models](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing#courses)
