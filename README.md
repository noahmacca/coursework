For code associated with various coursework. Generally in the format of jupyter notebooks and markdown files.

## Coursera
I'm currently working on the [NLP Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing) on Coursera. This is broken up into four courses:
1. [In Progress] [Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp)
2. [Not Started] [Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-models-in-nlp)
3. [Not Started] [Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp)
4. [Not Started] [Natural Language Processing with Attention Models](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing#courses)

## Udemy
This code is a record of my notes and practice code from Lazyprogrammer's great neural net courses. Mostly ipython notebooks. Going from numpy and logistic regression through tensorflow and convolutional neural nets.

Courses can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/).
